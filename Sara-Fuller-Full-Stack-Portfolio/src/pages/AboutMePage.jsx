        <p>
        I am a results-driven professional with a background in education and recent training in full stack development through the Rice University Full Stack Coding Boot Camp. 
        With five years of experience as an educator, I have developed strong problem-solving, analytical, and communication skills. 
        I am eager to transition into a career in software development, where I can apply my technical expertise and passion for coding to drive innovative solutions 
        and collaborate effectively within dynamic teams.
